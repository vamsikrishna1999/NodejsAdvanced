Working with node modules :
=========================

Node module is a javascript file.
It's a way to separate concerns for our application. 
How to expose the current module to other modules?


we export all modules to the module.js 

require(path) => compiles the file and returns the export obj 


Working with events:
===================

EventEmitter --> class
we can register events on predefined objects as well as user defined objects.
we can raise events using emit method present in event emittter. 


working with readline module:

readline --> interface

working with file system module:
===============================

The fs module provides an API for interacting with the file system in a manner closely modeled around standard POSIX functions.

creating files and directories

creating a stream object for existing file

Why should we use streams?
If we have a large file to be processed we can't just read the entire file directly since
buffer size is limited, so we use streams which reads chunks of data and flush the buffer once the chunk has been processed.

Working with pipes and pipe chaining:
====================================

pipe is similar to that of streams but pipe directly takes a writestream object to send data.



Creating a http server using the http module:

using http module.
we create a web server listening at some port.

It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js.
It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry.

Semantic Versioning:
===================

4.17.11 ==> here 4 indicates major version number
            here 17 indaicate minor version number
            here 11 indaicate patch number

==========================================
Working with express:
====================

express framework: express is a web framework for node js.

express is useful to create middleware for the node application.
