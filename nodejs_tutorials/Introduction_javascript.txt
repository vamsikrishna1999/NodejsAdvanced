Javascript is a Programming/Scripting Language


It was initially created to make web pages alive.


The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written inside web page's HTML and 
run automatically as the page loads.

scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don't need any preparation or compilation to run.


Javascript has its own specification called ECMAScript.

Today JS can execute not only in browser but also on the server, 
or actually any device that has a special program called the javascript engine.

A JavaScript engine is a computer program that executes JavaScript (JS) code. 
The first JavaScript engines were mere interpreters, 
but all relevant modern engines utilize just-in-time compilation for improved performance.

In a browser, the JavaScript engine runs in concert with the rendering engine via the Document Object Model.

=> The Chrome V8 engine is a core component of the popular Node.js runtime system.

=============

To render a document such as a HTML page, most web browsers use an internal model similar to the DOM. 
The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree, with the topmost node named as "Document object".
When an HTML page is rendered in browsers, the browser downloads the HTML into local memory and automatically parses it to display the page on screen.


Javascript:
==========
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page, which is an object oriented representation of an HTML document that acts as an interface between JavaScript and the document itself. 
This allows the creation of dynamic web pages,[9] because within a page JavaScript can:

add, change, and remove any of the HTML elements and attributes
change any of the CSS styles
react to all the existing events
create new events


Web browsers rely on layout engines to parse HTML into a DOM. Some layout engines, such as Trident/MSHTML, 
are associated primarily or exclusively with a particular browser, such as Internet Explorer. 
Others, including Blink, WebKit, and Gecko, are shared by a number of browsers, such as Google Chrome, Opera, Safari, and Firefox. 
The different layout engines implement the DOM standards to varying degrees of compliance



The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”


==========================================================================================
How do engines work?
Engines are complicated. But the basics are easy.

The engine (embedded if it’s a browser) reads (“parses”) the script.
Then it converts (“compiles”) the script to the machine language.
And then the machine code runs, pretty fast.
The engine applies optimizations at each step of the process. 
It even watches the compiled script as it runs, analyzes the data that flows through it, and further optimizes the machine code based on that knowledge.
